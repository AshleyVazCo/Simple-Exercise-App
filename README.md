 Lab 6: Updated Exercise App
For this lab, you will have two options: either implement the design you produced last week, or implement the provided design below.

This lab is completed in a new public Github repo, so that the final version can be published using gh-pages. 

gh-pages
For gh-pages, follow the directions on the following guide:

https://gist.github.com/vre2h/da9db3733c238c174d13670fb77c1f1a Links to an external site. 

Option 1: Implement your version from design exercise 5
You can include non-functional components (such as maps), but must include at the very minimum a new type of exercise as a component (e.g. in addition to RepetitionExercise or DurationExercise). 

Option 2: Alternative design
For the fallback design, create a new component, RunningExercise, that includes a new button to record laps that saves the current time to a list of times.

Laps should be shown at the bottom of the component and should be displayed using map using an array of lap times stored as an array. Laps can be stored on the component and do not need to be stored on the parent component.

You should first develop the lab in the class repository in unit1/lab6 (you can copy lab5 to start, or follow the solution video). Name the repository something appropriate for an exercise app.

You can then copy the contents of the lab into the new repository, then follow the instructions for gh-pages above.

Submit the URL to the github pages site (not the URL to the GitHub repository). This should be "<username>.github.io/<reponame>"
